xlwings - Make Excel fly with Python!
=====================================

xlwings CE
----------

xlwings CE is a `BSD-licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ Python library that makes it easy to call
Python from Excel and vice versa:

* **Scripting**: Automate/interact with Excel from Python using a syntax that is close to VBA.
* **Macros**: Replace your messy VBA macros with clean and powerful Python code.
* **UDFs**: Write User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Python (Windows only).
* **REST API**: Expose your Excel workbooks via REST API.

**Numpy arrays** and **Pandas Series/DataFrames** are fully supported. xlwings-powered workbooks are easy to distribute and work
on **Windows** and **Mac**.

xlwings CE includes all files in the xlwings package except the ``pro`` folder, i.e. the ``xlwings.pro`` subpackage.

xlwings PRO
-----------

The purpose of xlwings PRO is to finance the continued maintenance and enhancement of xlwings. This will allow you to rely on the package without being left with the dreaded `this library currently has no active maintainers <https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd>`_ message that happens to too many open-source packages after a couple of years.

xlwings PRO is a subscription that combines the ``xlwings.pro`` subpackage and additional services like dedicated support. It is licensed under a commercial license (see ``LICENSE_PRO.txt``) and must be used with a valid license key.
