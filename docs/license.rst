Zoomer Analytics makes no warranty regarding third party features or services. For a breach of the above warranty, Zoomer Analytics will, at no additional cost to Customer, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide remedial services necessary to enable the Software to conform to the warranty. If Zoomer Analytics is unable to restore such functionality, Customer shall be entitled to terminate the applicable Order Form and receive a pro rata refund of the fees paid.

The remedies set out in this subsection are Customer’s sole remedies for breach of the above warranty.
4.2.	Disclaimer. ZOOMER ANALYTICS DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS.

5.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

5.1.	Limitation on Indirect Liability. NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE.

5.3.	Exceptions to Limitations. The limitations of liability in Section 5.2 apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except that there is no limitation on loss, claims, or damages directly arising out of violations of: (i) a party's intellectual property rights by the other party; (ii) use of the Software in excess of the Product Limitations; or (iii) a party’s indemnification obligations.

6.	PRODUCT LIMITATIONS

6.1.	Usage verification. Customer understands and acknowledges that the Software may enforce its Product Limitations. Additionally, upon Zoomer Analytics’ written request, such request not to exceed once every six months, Customer shall provide Zoomer Analytics with a signed certification verifying that the Software is being used in accordance with this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, at Zoomer Analytics’ written request, Customer will permit Zoomer Analytics to review and verify Customer’s records, deployment, and use of the Software for compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at Zoomer Analytics’ expense. Any such review shall be scheduled at least ten days in advance, shall be conducted during normal business hours at Customer’s facilities, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities.
6.2.	Excess Usage. In the event that usage verification reveals the Software is being used in excess of the Product Limitations, following a reasonable notification period Customer shall be liable for, and Zoomer Analytics reserves the right to invoice Customer for, the fees for such excess usage at Zoomer Analytics’ then current list rates, or as otherwise set forth on the Order Form, notwithstanding the limitation on liability in Section 5.2 of this Agreement.

7.	CONFIDENTIALITY

7.1.	Confidential Information. During the term of this Agreement, each party will regard any information provided to it by the other party and designated in writing as proprietary or confidential as confidential (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information shall also include information which a reasonable person familiar with the disclosing party’s business and the industry in which it operates would know is of a confidential or proprietary nature. A party will not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, nor make use of any of the other party’s Confidential Information except in its performance under this Agreement. Each party accepts responsibility for the actions of its agents or employees and shall protect the other party’s Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care. The parties expressly agree that the terms and pricing of this Agreement are Confidential Information. A receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party upon becoming aware of a breach or threatened breach hereunder and shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the disclosing party in enforcing its rights.
7.2.	Exclusions. Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if such information: (i) is known prior to receipt from the disclosing party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes known to the receiving party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise publicly available, except through a breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law, legal process or government regulation, provided that, unless prohibited from doing so by law enforcement or court order, the receiving party gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice, and such disclosure is otherwise limited to the required disclosure.

8.	TERM & TERMINATION

The Subscription Term will not automatically renew. Instead, Zoomer Analytics will reach out 90 days before the end of the Term to see if Customer wants to renew. In case of a renewal, a new Agreement will be extended to the Customer.

This Agreement or an Order Form may be terminated: (i) by either party if the other party is adjudicated as bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against the other party and such petition is not discharged within sixty days of such filing; or (ii) by either party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement or the Order Form and fails to cure such breach to such party’s reasonable satisfaction within thirty days following receipt of written notice thereof. Customer’s license to use the Software shall also terminate upon the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term. Upon any termination of this Agreement or an Order Form by Zoomer Analytics, all applicable licenses are revoked and Customer shall immediately cease use of the applicable Software and certify in writing to Zoomer Analytics within thirty days that Customer has destroyed or returned to Zoomer Analytics such Software and all copies thereof. Termination of this Agreement or a license granted hereunder shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued, have been paid, or have become payable by Customer hereunder. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive such termination.

9.	INDEMNIFICATION

9.1.	By Zoomer Analytics. Zoomer Analytics will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a third-party claim that the Software infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property right of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Zoomer Analytics have any obligations or liability under this Section arising from: (i) use of any Software in a manner not anticipated by this Agreement or in combination with materials not furnished by Zoomer Analytics; or (ii) any content, information or data provided by Customer or other third parties. If the Software is or is likely to become subject to a claim of infringement or misappropriation, then Zoomer Analytics will, at its sole option and expense, either: (i) obtain for the Customer the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software to be non-infringing and substantially equivalent to the infringing Software; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above cannot be accomplished despite the reasonable efforts of Zoomer Analytics, then Zoomer Analytics may terminate Customer’s rights to use the infringing Software and will refund pro-rata any prepaid fees for the infringing portion of the Software. THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO CUSTOMER UNDER THIS SECTION 9.1 SHALL BE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY THE SOFTWARE OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT.
9.2.	By Customer. Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Zoomer Analytics from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a third party claim regarding Customer's: (i) use of the Software in violation of applicable law; or (ii) breach of the representation and warranty made in Section 2.7 of this Agreement.
