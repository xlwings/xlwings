"While xlwings is not technically thread safe, it's still easy to use it "
"in threads as long as you have at least v0.13.0 and stick to a simple "
"rule: Do not pass xlwings objects to threads. This rule isn't a "
"requirement on macOS, but it's still recommended if you want your "

"虽然xlwings在技术上并不是线程安全的，但是用在线程中也很便利，"
"只要版本在v0.13.0以上并且遵循一个简单的规则：不要把xlwings对象传递给线程。"
"在macOS中，这个规则不是硬性要求，但是如果你希望自己的程序能够跨平台，也还是建议遵循。"
