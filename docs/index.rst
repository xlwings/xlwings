xlwings - Make Excel Fly!
=========================

xlwings is a `BSD-licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ Python library that makes it easy to call
Python from Excel and vice versa:

* **Scripting**: Automate/interact with Excel from Python using a syntax that is close to VBA.
* **Macros**: Replace your messy VBA macros with clean and powerful Python code.
* **UDFs**: Write User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Python (Windows only).

**Numpy arrays** and **Pandas Series/DataFrames** are fully supported. xlwings-powered workbooks are easy to distribute and work
on **Windows** and **Mac**.

.. note:: xlwings is currently in an early stage.
   The API might change in backward incompatible ways.
