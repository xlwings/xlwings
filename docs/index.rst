=========================

xlwings is a `BSD-licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ Python library that makes it easy to call Python from Excel and vice versa:

* **Scripting**: Automate/interact with Excel from Python using a syntax close to VBA.
* **Macros**: Replace VBA macros with clean and powerful Python code.
* **UDFs**: Write User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Python (Windows only).
* **REST API**: Expose your Excel workbooks via REST API.

**Numpy arrays** and **Pandas Series/DataFrames** are fully supported. xlwings-powered workbooks are easy to distribute and work
on **Windows** and **Mac**.
