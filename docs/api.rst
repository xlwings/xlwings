=================

The xlwings object model is very similar to the one used by Excel VBA but the hierarchy is flattened. An example:

| **VBA:**
| ``Workbooks("Book1").Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value = "Some Text"``

| **xlwings:**
| ``wb = Workbook("Book1")``
| ``Range("Sheet1", "A1").value = "Some Text"``
