xlwings PRO
===========

The purpose of xlwings PRO is to finance the continued maintenance and enhancement of xlwings. This will allow you to rely on the package without being left with the dreaded `"this library currently has no active maintainers" <https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd>`_ message that happens to too many open-source packages after a couple of years.

xlwings PRO offers access to additional functionality. All PRO features are marked with xlwings :guilabel:`PRO` in the docs.

.. note::
    To get access to the additional functionality of xlwings PRO, you need a license key and at least xlwings v0.19.0. Everything under the ``xlwings.pro`` subpackage is distributed under a :ref:`commercial license <commercial_license>`.
