.. _xlwings_addin:

Add-in & Settings
=================

.. figure:: ./images/ribbon.png

The xlwings add-in is the preferred way to be able to use the ``Run main`` button, ``RunPython`` or ``UDFs``.
Note that you don't need an add-in if you just want to manipulate Excel by running a Python script.

.. note:: The ribbon of the add-in is compatible with Excel >= 2007 on Windows and >= 2016 on macOS.
  On macOS, all UDF related functionality is not available.

.. note:: The add-in is password protected with the password ``xlwings``. For debugging or to add new extensions, you need
  to unprotect it.

Run main
--------

.. versionadded:: 0.16.0

The ``Run main`` button is the easiest way to run your Python code: It runs a function called ``main`` in a Python
module that has the same name as your workbook. This allows you to save your workbook as ``xlsx`` without enabling macros.
The ``xlwings quickstart`` command will create a workbook that will automatically work with the ``Run`` button.

.. _addin_installation:

Installation
------------

To install the add-in, use the command line client::

    xlwings addin install

Technically, this copies the add-in from Python's installation directory to Excel's ``XLSTART`` folder. Then, to use ``RunPython`` or ``UDFs`` in a workbook, you need to set a reference to ``xlwings`` in the VBA editor, see screenshot (Windows: ``Tools > References...``, Mac: it's on the lower left corner of the VBA editor). Note that when you create a workbook via ``xlwings quickstart``, the reference should already be set.

.. figure:: ./images/vba_reference.png


.. _settings:

User Settings
-------------

When you install the add-in for the first time, it will get auto-configured and therefore, a ``quickstart`` project should work out of the box. For fine-tuning, here are the available settings:

* ``Interpreter``: This is the path to the Python interpreter. This works also with virtual or conda envs on Mac.
  If you use conda envs on Windows, then leave this empty and use ``Conda Path`` and ``Conda Env`` below instead. Examples:
  ``"C:\Python39\pythonw.exe"`` or ``"/usr/local/bin/python3.9"``. Note that in the settings,
  this is stored as ``Interpreter_Win`` or ``Interpreter_Mac``, respectively, see below!
* ``PYTHONPATH``: If the source file of your code is not found, add the path to its directory here.
* ``Conda Path``: If you are on Windows and use Anaconda or Miniconda, then type here the path to your
  installation, e.g. ``C:\Users\Username\Miniconda3`` or ``%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda``. NOTE that you need at least conda 4.6!
  You also need to set ``Conda Env``, see next point.
* ``Conda Env``: If you are on Windows and use Anaconda or Miniconda, type here the name of your conda env, e.g. ``base``
  for the base installation or ``myenv`` for a conda env with the name ``myenv``.
* ``UDF Modules``: Names of Python modules (without .py extension) from which the UDFs are being imported.
  Separate multiple modules by ";".
  Example: ``UDF_MODULES = "common_udfs;myproject"``
  The default imports a file in the same directory as the Excel spreadsheet with the same name but ending in ``.py``.
* ``Debug UDFs``: Check this box if you want to run the xlwings COM server manually for debugging, see :ref:`debugging:debugging`.
* ``RunPython: Use UDF Server``:  Uses the same COM Server for RunPython as for UDFs. This will be faster, as the
  interpreter doesn't shut down after each call.
* ``Restart UDF Server``: This restarts the UDF Server/Python interpreter.
* ``Show Console``: Check the box in the ribbon or set the config to ``TRUE`` if you want the command prompt to pop up. This currently only works on Windows.
* ``ADD_WORKBOOK_TO_PYTHONPATH``: Uncheck this box to not automatically add the directory of your workbook to the PYTHONPATH. This can be helpful if you experience issues with OneDrive/SharePoint: uncheck this box and provide the path where your source file is manually via the PYTHONPATH setting.

Anaconda/Miniconda
******************

If you use Anaconda or Miniconda on Windows, you will need to set your ``Conda Path`` and ``Conda Env`` settings, as you will
otherwise get errors when using ``NumPy`` etc. In return, leave ``Interpreter`` empty.

.. _config_file:

Making use of Environment Variables
-----------------------------------

With environment variables, you can set dynamic paths e.g. to your interpreter or ``PYTHONPATH``:

* On Windows, you can use all environment variables like so: ``%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda``.
* On macOS, the following special variables are supported: ``$HOME``, ``$APPLICATIONS``, ``$DOCUMENTS``, ``$DESKTOP``.

.. _config_hierarchy:

Config Hierarchy
----------------


xlwings looks for settings in the following locations and order:

* **Workbook configuration**

  First, xlwings looks for a sheet called ``xlwings.conf``. This is the recommended way to configure your workbook for deployment as you don't have to handle an additional config file. When you run the quickstart command, it will create a sample configuration on a sheet called ``_xlwings.conf``: remove the leading underscore in the name to activate it. If you don't want to use it, feel free to delete the sheet.

* **Directory configuration**

  Next, xlwings looks for a file called ``xlwings.conf`` in the same directory as your Excel workbook.

* **User configuration**

  Finally, xlwings looks for a file called ``xlwings.conf`` in the ``.xlwings`` folder in the user's home directory. Normally, you don't edit this file directlyâ€”instead, it is created and edited by the add-in whenever you change a setting.

You will find more details about the each configuration type below.

.. _user_config:

User Config: Ribbon/Config File
-------------------------------

The settings in the xlwings Ribbon are stored in a config file that can also be manipulated externally. The location is

* Windows: ``.xlwings\xlwings.conf`` in your home folder, that is usually ``C:\Users\<username>``
* macOS: ``~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/xlwings.conf``

The format is as follows (currently the keys are required to be all caps) - note the OS specific Interpreter settings!

.. code-block:: bash

    "INTERPRETER_WIN","C:\path\to\python.exe"
    "INTERPRETER_MAC","/path/to/python"
    "PYTHONPATH",""
    "ADD_WORKBOOK_TO_PYTHONPATH",""
    "CONDA PATH",""
    "CONDA ENV",""
    "UDF MODULES",""
    "DEBUG UDFS",""
    "USE UDF SERVER",""
    "SHOW CONSOLE",""
    "ONEDRIVE_CONSUMER_WIN",""
    "ONEDRIVE_CONSUMER_WIN",""
    "ONEDRIVE_COMMERCIAL_WIN",""
    "ONEDRIVE_COMMERCIAL_MAC",""
    "SHAREPOINT_WIN",""
    "SHAREPOINT_MAC",""

.. note::
    The ``ONEDRIVE_WIN/_MAC`` setting has to be edited directly in the file, there is currently no possibility to edit it via the ribbon. Usually, it is only required if you are either on macOS or if your environment variables on Windows are not correctly set or if you have a private and corporate location and don't want to go with the default one. ``ONEDRIVE_WIN/_MAC`` has to point to the root folder of your local OneDrive folder.

Directory Config: Config file
-----------------------------

The global settings of the Ribbon/Config file can be overridden for one or more workbooks by creating a ``xlwings.conf`` file
in the workbook's directory.

.. note::
    Workbook directory config files are not supported if your workbook is stored on SharePoint or OneDrive.

.. _addin_wb_settings:

Workbook Config: xlwings.conf Sheet
-----------------------------------

Workbook specific settings will override global (Ribbon) and workbook directory config files: 
Workbook specific settings are set by listing the config key/value pairs in a sheet with the name ``xlwings.conf``.
When you create a new project with ``xlwings quickstart``, it'll already have such a sheet but you need to rename
it from ``_xlwings.conf`` to ``xlwings.conf`` to make it active.


.. figure:: ./images/workbook_config.png


Alternative: Standalone VBA module
----------------------------------

Sometimes, it might be useful to run xlwings code without having to install an add-in first. To do so, you
need to use the ``standalone`` option when creating a new project: ``xlwings quickstart myproject --standalone``.

This will add the content of the add-in as a single VBA module so you don't need to set a reference to the add-in anymore.
It will also include ``Dictionary.cls`` as this is required on macOS.
It will still read in the settings from your ``xlwings.conf`` if you don't override them by using a sheet with the name ``xlwings.conf``.
