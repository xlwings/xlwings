.. _xlwings_addin:

Add-in & Settings
=================

.. figure:: images/ribbon.png
    :scale: 40%

The xlwings add-in is the preferred way to be able to use the ``Run main`` button, ``RunPython`` or ``UDFs``.
Note that you don't need an add-in if you just want to manipulate Excel from Python via xlwings.

.. note:: The ribbon of the add-in is compatible with Excel >= 2007 on Windows and >= 2016 on Mac.
  On Mac, all UDF related functionality is not available.

.. note:: The add-in is password protected with the password ``xlwings``. For debugging or to add new extensions, you need
  to unprotect it.

Run main
--------

.. versionadded:: 0.16.0

The ``Run main`` button is the easiest to run your Python code: It runs a function called ``main`` in a Python
module that has the same name as your workbook. This allows you to save your workbook as ``xlsx`` without enabling macros.
The ``xlwings quickstart`` command will create a workbook that will automatically work with the ``Run`` button.

.. _addin_installation:

Installation
------------

To install the add-in, it's easiest to use the command line client: ``xlwings addin install``. Technically, this copies the add-in
from Python's installation directory to Excel's ``XLSTART`` folder. If you encounter issues, then you can also download the 
add-in (``xlwings.xlam``) from the `GitHub Release page <https://github.com/ZoomerAnalytics/xlwings/releases>`_
(make sure you download the same version as the version of the Python package). Once downloaded, you can install the add-in
by going to ``Developer > Excel Add-in > Browse``. If you don't see ``Developer`` as tab in your ribbon, make sure to
activate the tab first under ``File > Options > Customize Ribbon`` (Mac: ``Cmd + , > Ribbon & Toolbar``).


Then, to use ``RunPython`` or ``UDFs`` in a workbook, you need to set a reference to ``xlwings`` in the VBA editor, see
screenshot (Windows: ``Tools > References...``, Mac: it's on the lower left corner of the VBA editor). Note that when
you create a workbook via ``xlwings quickstart``, the reference is already set.

.. _settings:

User Settings
-------------

While the defaults will often work out-of-the box, you can change the global settings directly in the add-in:

* ``Interpreter``: This is the path to the Python interpreter. This works also with virtual or conda envs on Mac.
  If you use conda envs on Windows, then use ``Conda Path`` and ``Conda Env`` below instead. Examples:
  ``"C:\Python35\pythonw.exe"`` or ``"/usr/local/bin/python3.5"``. An empty field defaults to ``pythonw`` that
  expects the interpreter to be set in the ``PATH`` on Windows or ``.bash_profile`` on Mac.
* ``PYTHONPATH``: If the source file of your code is not found, add the path here.
* ``Conda Path``: If you are on Windows and use Anaconda or Miniconda, then type here the path to your
  installation, e.g. ``C:\Users\Username\Miniconda3`` or ``%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda``. NOTE that you need at least conda 4.6!
  You also need to set ``Conda Env``, see next point.
* ``Conda Env``: If you are on Windows and use Anaconda or Miniconda, type here the name of your conda env, e.g. ``base``
  for the base installation or ``myenv`` for a conda env with the name ``myenv``. Note
  that this requires you to either leave the ``Interpreter`` blank or set it to one of ``python`` or ``pythonw``.
* ``UDF Modules``: Names of Python modules (without .py extension) from which the UDFs are being imported.
  Separate multiple modules by ";".
  Example: ``UDF_MODULES = "common_udfs;myproject"``
  The default imports a file in the same directory as the Excel spreadsheet with the same name but ending in ``.py``.
* ``Debug UDFs``: Check this box if you want to run the xlwings COM server manually for debugging, see :ref:`debugging`.
* ``RunPython: Use UDF Server``:  Uses the same COM Server for RunPython as for UDFs. This will be faster, as the
  interpreter doesn't shut down after each call.
* ``Restart UDF Server``: This shuts down the UDF Server/Python interpreter. It'll be restarted upon the next function call.

Anaconda/Miniconda
******************

If you use Anaconda or Miniconda on Windows, you will need to set your ``Conda Path`` and ``Conda Env`` settings, as you will
otherwise get errors when using ``NumPy`` etc. In return, leave ``Interpreter`` empty or use either ``python`` (shows output in the terminal) or ``pythonw`` (doesn't show output in the terminal).

.. note:: If you use ``Conda Path`` and ``Conda Env`` with UDFs, you currently can't hide the command prompt that pops up.

.. _config_file:

Global Config: Ribbon/Config File
---------------------------------

The settings in the xlwings Ribbon are stored in a config file that can also be manipulated externally. The location is

* Windows: ``.xlwings\xlwings.conf`` in your user folder  
* macOS: ``~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/xlwings.conf``

The format is as follows (keys are uppercase):

.. code-block:: bash

    "INTERPRETER","pythonw"
    "PYTHONPATH",""

Workbook Directory Config: Config file
--------------------------------------

The global settings of the Ribbon/Config file can be overridden for one or more workbooks by creating a ``xlwings.conf`` file
in the workbook's directory.

.. _addin_wb_settings:

Workbook Config: xlwings.conf Sheet
-----------------------------------

Workbook specific settings will override global (Ribbon) and workbook directory config files: 
Workbook specific settings are set by listing the config key/value pairs in a sheet with the name ``xlwings.conf``.
When you create a new project with ``xlwings quickstart``, it'll already have such a sheet but you need to rename
it to ``xlwings.conf`` to make it active.

Alternative: Standalone VBA module
----------------------------------

Sometimes it might be useful to run xlwings code without having to install an add-in first. To do so, you
need to use the ``standalone`` option when creating a new project: ``xlwings quickstart myproject --standalone``.

This will add the content of the add-in as a single VBA module so you don't need to set a reference to the add-in anymore.
It will still read in the settings from your ``xlwings.conf`` if you don't override them by using a sheet with the name ``xlwings.conf``.
